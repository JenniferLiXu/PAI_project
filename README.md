# PAItask

Projects for successful completion of the course Probabilistic Artifical Intelligence led by Prof. Andreas Krause at ETH Zurich, 2021. Evaluated on black-box test data in a fixed environment.


### Project0

Exact bayesian inference outputting posterior probabilities, given fixed prior probabilities for sampling from three known distributions, they are: Normal, Laplace, student.



### Project1 GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION

Implementation of a Gaussian Process regression applied on a real world inference problem (model air pollution and predict fine particle concentration at new coordinate locations).
keyword: model selection, GP inference complexity O(n^3) and asymmetric cost handling.




### Project2 BAYESIAN NEURAL NETS 

Bayesian neural network implementation based on the ’Bayes by Backprop’ algorithm. for multi-class classification on the MNIST dataset. The test set contains added uncertainty via pixelation and random rotations. Additional calibration measurements of predictions
algorithm implementation, weight prior and variational posterior selection, calibration considerations.



### Project3 BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION

Implementation of Bayesian optimization under constraints to the feasible domain (2D grid)
joint training of constraint and objective, acquisition function choice, constraint satisfaction.



### Project4 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

Reinforcement learning task using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
It is a model-free policy gradient approach with two neural networks as actor and critic respectively. The control task is to learn a policy to smoothly descend a lunar lander to the ground in between two flags with minimal fuel use and without damaging it.
keyword: dual neural network parametrizations, improving rewards structure, extending vanilla policy gradients with advantage estimation.
